# Self-Hosting

Self-hosting **lua.sh** allows you to have full control over your URL shortening service, ensuring scalability, reliability, and performance. Below is a generic guideline to set up **lua.sh** while respecting the recommended minimum infrastructure.

## Recommended Minimum Infrastructure

To achieve optimal performance and scalability, we recommend the following server configuration:

- **Load Balancer**: Distributes traffic between application servers for better reliability and redundancy.
- **2 PHP Machines**: Handles the application logic and serves requests.
- **Redis Machine or Cluster**: Manages caching and queues to ensure smooth operations.
- **MySQL Database Machine or Cluster**: Stores and manages your data efficiently.

## Schema Overview
```
                      User
                        |
                        v
                  Load Balancer
                        |
        +-------------------------------+
        |                               |
        v                               v
    PHP Server 1                    PHP Server 2
        |                               |
  +-------------+                 +-------------+
  |             |                 |             |
  v             v                 v             v
Redis         MySQL             Redis         MySQL
```

### **Load Balancer**
- **Purpose**: Directs incoming traffic to your PHP machines, balancing the load and improving reliability.
- **Requirements**: Configured with health checks to monitor the availability of application servers.
- **Optional Enhancements**:
  - Sticky sessions, if needed.
  - SSL termination for secure communication.

### **PHP Machines**
- **Purpose**: Runs the application code, processes user requests, and interfaces with Redis and the database.
- **Configuration**:
  - Deploy **lua.sh** and ensure the environment variables (`.env`) are consistent across all PHP machines.
  - Use file synchronization or a shared file system for consistency in file uploads and other shared resources.
  - Configure queue workers using a process manager like Supervisor or Systemd.
- **Scaling**: Add more PHP machines to handle increased traffic.

### **Redis Machine**
- **Purpose**: Provides fast caching and queue management for optimal performance.
- **Configuration**:
  - Set a secure password and restrict access to trusted application servers.
  - Update your `.env` file on PHP machines with the Redis server details.
- **Scaling**: As traffic grows, consider scaling vertically (larger machine) or horizontally (clustering).

### **Database Machine**
- **Purpose**: Stores application data securely and reliably.
- **Configuration**:
  - Use a relational database (e.g., MySQL or MariaDB).
  - Ensure database backups are set up and tested regularly.
  - Optimize your database for high performance (e.g., indexing, query optimization).
- **Scaling**:
  - For read-heavy workloads, set up replication with a primary database and read replicas.
  - For write-heavy workloads, consider sharding or a larger instance.

## General Deployment Tips

1. **Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure all machines share consistent `.env` files, particularly for database and Redis configurations.
   - Configure the `APP_URL` to point to your load balancer or main domain.

2. **Monitoring and Logging**:
   - Enable logging on all machines to track errors and performance.
   - Set up monitoring tools to observe resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, etc.) and application metrics.

3. **Security**:
   - Use firewalls to restrict access between servers.
   - Enable HTTPS for all external traffic.
   - Regularly update your application and server software.

4. **Backups**:
   - Regularly back up your database.
   - If applicable, back up Redis data and application files (e.g., uploads).

5. **Scaling**:
   - As traffic increases, you can scale each component independently:
     - Add more PHP machines.
     - Scale Redis and database machines vertically or horizontally.

## Final Notes

This guide provides a general structure for hosting **lua.sh**. The actual implementation will depend on your specific environment, tools, and hosting provider. Focus on creating a setup that ensures redundancy, scalability, and performance while aligning with your project goals. ðŸš€
