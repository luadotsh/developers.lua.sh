# Authentication

To access any endpoint in the Mercantive API, you need to authenticate your requests using a bearer token. This guide explains how to use bearer token authentication with our API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Bearer Token

You can find your API token in the Mercantive [Settings &raquo; API](https://app.mercantive.com/settings/api).

To authenticate your requests, include your bearer token in the Authorization header:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with bearer token' }}
curl https://lua.sh/api/v1/customers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
