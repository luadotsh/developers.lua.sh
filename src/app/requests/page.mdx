# Making Requests

All API requests must be made over HTTPS to `https://lua.sh/api/v1`. Calls made over plain HTTP will fail. API requests without authentication will also fail.

The Lua API uses JSON for request and response bodies. The following headers must be included with all requests to the API:

* `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`
* `Content-Type: application/json`
* `Accept: application/json`
