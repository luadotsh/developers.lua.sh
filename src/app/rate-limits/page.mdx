# Rate Limits

To help you monitor whether your application is being rate-limited or nearing that threshold, we include the following HTTP headers in our successful responses:

- `X-Ratelimit-Limit`: The maximum number of API calls allowed per minute.
- `X-Ratelimit-Remaining`: The number of API calls remaining in the current time window.

The limit is set at 60 API calls per minute.

If this limit is exceeded, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
