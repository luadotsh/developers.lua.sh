# Rate Limits

To help you monitor whether your application is being rate-limited or nearing that threshold, we include the following HTTP headers in our successful responses:

- `X-Ratelimit-Limit`: The maximum number of API calls allowed per minute.
- `X-Ratelimit-Remaining`: The number of API calls remaining in the current time window.

The rate limit will depends on your plan:

- **Free Plan**: 60 requests per minute.
- **Starter Plan**: 120 requests per minute.
- **Pro Plan**: 200 requests per minute.
- **Growth Plan**: 400 requests per minute.
- **Scale Plan**: 1,000 requests per minute.


If this limit is exceeded, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.
